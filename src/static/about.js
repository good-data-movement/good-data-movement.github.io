## What is the Good Data Movement?

The Good Data Movement is a social movement, an Open-source community-led organisation, and campaign group for fair, ethical and non-exploitative data use.

We aim to consolidate and act as a central reference point for the many people feeling concerned with how litte control they have over how their data is used, and to unite the efforts of individuals and organisations working to advance the potential social benefits of **good** data use. 

## Why Good Data Movement?

- Because even after continued exploitation nothing has changed.
- Because the problem is too large for any individual to make a difference.
- Because a movement can consolidate existing information and efforts.
- Because change can only come from working together. 
- Because there isn't anything like this.

## Aims

### For individuals to:

- Know where their data is, how it is used, and what it means.
- Make informed consent choices that are respected.
- Get dividends from any value generated from their data.

### For companies to:

- Join the _Good Data_ [*Alliance*](https://github.com/good-data-movement/manifesto/blob/master/alliance.md).
- Ensure individuals data is kept private.
- Provide clear consent options with opt-out as default.
- Question the source from which they obtain data.
- Recognise the benefits of treating customers well.

## How
